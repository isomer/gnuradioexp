# M7EPL's GNURadio Experiments

My experiments with gnuradio.

## How to use

1. Open, and run `mrc.grc`.  (looks like a play icon on the toolbar) This will compile then finish immediately.
1. Open, and run `phase_match.grc`.  (looks like a play icon on the toolbar) This will compile then finish immediately.
1. Use "Reload Blocks" (looks like two arrows in a circle icon on the toolbar)
   * A new "E7EPL" section should appear on the right hand side, containing both blocks above, if not repeat the process above for the missing block.
1. Open diversity2.grc and hit "Play".
   1. Remember to change the volume and source if you want to hear anything.
   * It's likely you don't have the same SDR setup as me, you'll need to replace the SDR block with some other source.
